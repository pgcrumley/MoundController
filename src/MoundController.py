Control a pump which moves water through a compost pile by capturing
data from DS18B20 sensors which are attached to
Arduinos accessed by serial ports.

This code assumes the controllers use either the 
    DS18B20_SampleOnDemand
or
    DS18B20_Fast_SampleOnDemand 
sketches as the communication protocol for both is the same.  (e.g. send NL
then retrieve data till an empty line is received)

The sensors are segregated in to two groups:
  "watched" sensors are used to control the state of the pump
  "monitored" sensors are used to collect data on the temperature of the pile
  
  The "monitored" sensors are continually sampled at a base frequency.
  
  When the pump is running the "watched" sensors are sampled more often to 
  capture more data on the amount of energy being removed from the pile.
  
  The pumping algorithm is a loop which does the following:
    Start the pump (and faster samples on watched sensors)
    Let the water circulate for 30 seconds.
    Each time the watched sensors are read, record the output temperature
    While the temperature is above PUMP_THRESHOLD
      keep pumping
    When the temperature is at or below PUMP_THRESHOLD
      Turn off the pump
      Return the sampling rate of the watched sensors to the monitor rate
      Wait 120 minutes
    Loop back to the top of this sequence
