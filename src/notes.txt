Moved to "Phase 2" of project on September 16 - 23
----------

Saved old data in "*phase1" directories

New Pump Algorithm:
  The pumping algorithm is a loop which does the following:
    Start the pump (and faster samples on watched sensors)
    Let the water circulate for 30 seconds.
    Each time the watched sensors are read, record the output temperature
    While the temperature is above PUMP_THRESHOLD
      keep pumping
    When the temperature is at or below PUMP_THRESHOLD
      Turn off the pump
      Return the sampling rate of the watched sensors to the monitor rate
      Wait 120 minutes
    Loop back to the top of this sequence 
    
Problems with current pipe sensors.  For now:
    Inlet is sensor Y
    Outlet is sensor TBD (broken)
    pipe sensor W is just hanging out in the air -- will put in pipe at outlet

Relay for pump is broken.  
    Moved from first to second relay (on 4 relay card).
    This only involves moving wires, the code still uses GPIO 17.

Source code is now in github
----------
Added source code to github in case it can be helpful to others.
